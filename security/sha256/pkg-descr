The md5 and sha256 programs are command-line utilities originating with
FreeBSD.  Their purpose is to generate message digests.

The core hash routines were implemented by Colin Percival based on the
published FIPS 180-2 standard.  Matt Dillon modified them to use
OpenSSL/LibreSSL routines to avoid conflicts with libmd.
